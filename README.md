Here's a project for solving quadratic equations. It takes the values ​​of a, b, and c, then calculates the roots. 
If d is greater than zero, it shows different real roots.
If d is equal to zero, it shows a single root. If d is less than zero, it shows imaginary roots.
It uses the square root formula to calculate the roots.
